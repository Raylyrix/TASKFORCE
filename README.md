# AutoMailer Pro

A comprehensive automatic email sender with Google Sheets integration, scheduling capabilities, modern GUI interface, and **enhanced attachment support**.

> Note: We distribute installers only (no source code bundles). Download a single installer from Releases and run it — it will set up the app, create Start Menu/Desktop shortcuts, and auto‑update. Installers fetch any missing components automatically.

### Download and Install (Desktop App)

Use the packaged Electron desktop app for the easiest setup on Windows and macOS.

- Go to Releases: https://github.com/Raylyrix/RTK/releases
- Download the single installer for your OS:
  - Windows (single file): `RTX Innovations Web Setup <version>.exe` (web installer)
  - macOS (single file): `RTX Innovations-<version>.pkg`

#### Windows (Web Setup .exe)
1) Double‑click the `.exe`. It will download any required components automatically.
2) The installer runs with one click, installs, creates desktop and Start menu shortcuts, and launches the app.
3) If SmartScreen warns: click “More info” → “Run anyway”.

#### macOS (.pkg)
1) Double‑click the `.pkg` and follow the prompts (Continue → Agree → Install).
2) App installs into Applications and is ready to run from Spotlight or Launchpad.
3) If blocked by Gatekeeper: right‑click the installer → Open → Open.

#### First‑run setup
- Click “Login” → “Upload credentials” and select your Google OAuth `credentials.json`.
- A browser window opens; sign in and approve Gmail/Sheets permissions.
- On success, the app saves your token and returns to the app.

#### Auto‑updates
- The app checks for updates on launch and will prompt when a new version is available.
- Click “Download” then “Install” when prompted; the app restarts into the new version (e.g., v3).

#### Troubleshooting (quick)
- Windows: SmartScreen → “More info” → “Run anyway”.
- macOS: Gatekeeper → right‑click → Open (or System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway).
- Network: Allow the app to access the Internet to sign in, download updates, and send email.
- Logs: Use the in‑app Logs panel and follow guidance.

## Google Sheets Format

Your Google Sheets should have:

- **Data rows**: One recipient per row

Example sheet structure:
```
Name          | Email               | Company      | Position
John Doe      | john@example.com    | Acme Corp    | Manager

## Placeholder System

Use double parentheses to create placeholders that will be replaced with data from your sheet:

- `((Name))` - Replaced with the Name column value
- `((Company))` - Replaced with the Company column value
- `((Position))` - Replaced with the Position column value

**Example Email Template:**
```
Subject: Welcome to our newsletter, ((Name))!

Hello ((Name)),

Thank you for your interest in our services. We noticed you work at ((Company)) as a ((Position)).

Please find our company brochure attached for your reference.

Best regards,
Marketing Team
```

### Best Practices for Attachments:
1. **Optimize File Sizes**: Compress large files when possible

3. **Monitor Logs**: Check logs for attachment processing errors
4. **Batch Considerations**: Larger attachments may slow down sending

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Credentials file not found"**
   - Ensure `credentials.json` is in the project root
   - Check the file path in Settings tab

2. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Check your Google Cloud Project setup
   - Ensure APIs are enabled
   - Verify OAuth consent screen configuration

3. **"No email column found"**
   - Ensure your sheet has a column with "email" or "mail" in the name
   - Check column headers in your Google Sheet

4. **"Quota exceeded" errors**
   - Reduce batch size
   - Increase time gaps between emails
   - Check Gmail API quotas in Google Cloud Console

5. **"Invalid placeholders" (FIXED!)**
   - Use the "Validate Placeholders" button
   - Improved error handling now provides better feedback
   - Placeholders are case-insensitive and handle empty values

6. **"Attachment too large"**
   - Check individual file sizes
   - Ensure total attachments don't exceed 25MB
   - Use file compression for large documents

7. **"Error fetching placeholder" (FIXED!)**
   - Enhanced placeholder processing with better error handling
   - Supports null/empty values in sheet data
   - Improved validation and debugging

### Email Limits

- **Gmail API Daily Quota**: 1 billion quota units per day
- **Sending Limits**: Up to 2000 emails per day for new accounts
- **Rate Limits**: 250 quota units per user per 100 seconds
- **Attachment Limit**: 25MB total per email

### Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Test with a small batch first
2. **Use Time Gaps**: Add delays to avoid spam detection
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check logs for any issues
4. **Validate Data**: Always preview and validate before sending
5. **Backup Templates**: Save your successful templates with attachments
6. **Test Attachments**: Send test emails before bulk campaigns
